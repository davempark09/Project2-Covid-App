The purpose of this project is to show how important correct and valid information is to a person's decision making especially when it has to do with the health of that individual and everyone around them. This app was just an example of how to approach and inform people on the web in a simple and appealing manner so that they don't feel pushed into finding more information on the topic since overloading with information happens to many people all over the world but with this app they could take their time and when they so desire they could find out more about the topic when they themselves feel like it. The target user for this app would be individuals seeking more information and statistical data about the Covid-19 virus and honestly everyone else as well. Information and especially important information like those in regards to health and safety are not for any specific target group but for everyone and as such should be available to everyone not just a target group of people.
